This is still a WIP! Some stylings are incomplete or missing.

# ESSSASS
#### Extra Space Storage (with) Symantically Awesome StyleSheets
Style baseline &amp; guide for Breeze.

## What You Need
The only directory here that matters to the Breeze application is "_sass". It could (should!) be copied directly into Breeze. Everything else is an artifact of my Jekyll installation that we use to compile elements into a formatted, living style guide for reference throughout the project. Also be sure to remove the Jekyll style folder and remove its includes from `_breeze.scss`.

## Requirements
This brief documentation is assuming your working environment is already established and will outline only assets related to SASS and styling.

### Bootstrap for SASS
[https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass]

Use Bootstrap elements referenced straight from [their docs](http://getbootstrap.com/css/). The essentials have been overridden to match Breeze application styles.

### Bourbon
[http://bourbon.io]

A SASS mixin library to make life easier.

### Neat
[http://neat.bourbon.io]

A semantic grid systyem built on Bourbon. It's much more flexible than the grid mixins packed with Bootstrap. Here are some [usage examples](http://neat.bourbon.io/examples/).

### Font Awesome
[https://github.com/FortAwesome/font-awesome-sass]

This is our icon library and here is a [handy reference](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/).

## HELP!
Please reach out to Nathan at Slalom if you have questions about this library or general HTML/CSS issues via Email/Hipchat nathan.peters@slalom.com.
