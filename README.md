# ESSSASS
Style Base &amp; Guide for Breeze

## What You Need
The only directory here that matters to the Breeze application is "_sass". It could (should!) be copied directly into Breeze. Everything else is an artifact of my Jekyll installation that I'll use to compile elements into a formatted living style guide for reference throughout the project.

## Requirements
This brief documentation is assuming your working environment is already established and will outline only assets related to SASS and styling.

### Bootstrap for SASS
[https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass]

Use Bootstrap elements referenced straight from [their docs](http://getbootstrap.com/css/). The essentials have been overridden to match Breeze application styles.

### Modular Scale
[https://github.com/modularscale/modularscale-sass]

### Font Awesome
[https://github.com/FortAwesome/font-awesome-sass]
